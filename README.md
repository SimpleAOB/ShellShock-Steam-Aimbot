# ShellShockLive Aimbot (Steam Version)
## How To Use:
Have shellshock opened with the screen resolution of 1680x1050 (**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**). The application will automatically over itself on top of the game.

## Important Notes:
* The tracer is **_not_ 100% accurate**, err on the side of caution when aiming. Practice in the firing range first to get a hang of it. The tracer tends to undershoot at lower angles and overshoot at steeper angles. I chose a middle ground for values that would work the best overall.

## ToDo:
* Factor for wind
